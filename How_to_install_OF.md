# Installing Open Fortress
In this method, we will be using SVN because of Open Fortress's GitHub having issues due to bandwidth limits.

First, you need a SVN Client. This is required to install Open Fortress. I will show how to install it.
Download TortoiseSVN here:
https://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html

However, Version 1.13 will not work with this method.

The installer will take a while to start so if you don't see the `next` you just have to wait a bit.
The best setup for most users should look like this.

After setup is done, Locate your sourcemods folder.
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods` is the normal location.

Right click the folder and click SVN Checkout.

As the url, put: `https://svn.openfortress.fun/svn/open_fortress` in there.

Add \open_fortress\ to the path if it hasn't set itself automatically

Just put `ofs` as the username, and leave the password blank.

It should start downloading if you pressed OK.

Simpily right click inside the folder and click Update.
